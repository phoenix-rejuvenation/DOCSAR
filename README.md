# DOCSAR: The Distributed Database of Chemical Substances and Reactions

DOCSAR is an open-source blockchain-based platform that democratizes access to chemical knowledge, addressing the current issue of monopolistic access to chemical databases by big institutions such as big pharma.

## Motivation behind the project 

DOCSAR is an open-source blockchain-based platform democratizing access to chemical knowledge, addressing monopolistic access by big institutions. Despite AI's potential in drug discovery, the lack of free chemical data has limited small research groups. DOCSAR uses blockchain to enable users to store and share chemical data, facilitating machine learning models and accelerating research in medicine, biotechnology, and material design. By providing access to anyone with an internet connection, DOCSAR fosters innovation and collaboration in chemical research.

## System Components

1. **User Management**: Every user in the system is represented by a unique ID, a pair of keys (public and private), a contact address, a contact protocol, and a set of grants that define their permissions. The contact protocol and address are flexible, future-proofing the platform against changes in communication technology. This blockchain, due to the project's nature, supports account handover, which allows an account to be suspended and its activity history to be passed to a new account. This is typically done when an administrator of an organization changes and a new private key is needed. For this reason, only accounts with Grant A can be migrated.

2. **Points System**: The system incentivizes user contributions via a points system. Actions performed by users, such as adding substance and reaction definitions, and verifying existing definitions, are associated with points. These points can be transferred between users in transaction blocks. The points associated with each action are defined globally by the supreme account in a Points Definition Block.

3. **Chemical Substance and Reaction Definitions**: Users can add blocks to the blockchain containing detailed definitions of chemical substances and reactions. These definitions are not limited to basic information such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, molecular weights, but can also include extensive data on structural information, properties, reaction conditions, reaction mechanisms, and more.

## Block Schemas

Several types of blocks can be added to the DOCSAR blockchain:

1. **User Block**: Contains user ID, public key, contact information (protocol and address), and grant level. The block schema is as follows:
```json
{
  "UserID": "string",
  "PublicKey": "string",
  "Contact": {
    "Protocol": "string",
    "Address": "string"
  },
  "Grant": "string"
}
```
2. **Points Definition Block**: Issued by the supreme account, it defines the number of points associated with each action type.
```json
{
  "BlockIssuerID": "string",
  "ActionTypePoints": [
    {
      "ActionType": "string",
      "Points": "float"
    }
  ]
}
```
3. **Transaction Block**: Records the transfer of points between users.
```json
{
  "SenderUserID": "string",
  "ReceiverUserID": "string",
  "Points": "float",
  "Timestamp": "string"
}
```
4. **Chemical Substance Definition Block**: Contains information about a chemical substance.
```json
{
  "BlockIssuerID": "string",
  "SubstanceID": "string",
  "SubstanceData": {
    "IUPACName": "string",
    "MolecularFormula": "string",
    "MolecularWeight": "float",
    "Structure": "string",
    "Properties": {
      "Physical": "string",
      "Chemical": "string"
    },
    "SafetyNote": "string",
    "ToxicityIndex": "number"
  },
  "Timestamp": "string"
}
```
5. **Chemical Reaction Definition Block**: Contains information about a chemical reaction.
```json
{
  "BlockIssuerID": "string",
  "ReactionID": "string",
  "ReactionData": {
    "Reactants": [
      {
        "SubstanceID": "string",
        "Quantity": "float"
      }
    ],
    "Products": [
      {
        "SubstanceID": "string",
        "Quantity": "float"
      }
    ],
    "Conditions": "string",
    "Mechanism": "string"
  },
  "Timestamp": "string"
}
```
6. **Chemical Reaction/Substance Verification Block**: Created once per cemical substance or reaction.
```json
{
  "BlockIssuerID": "string",
  "NowVerifiedBlockID" : "string",
  "Timestamp": "string"
}
```
## Grant Levels

DOCSAR uses a system of grant levels to control user permissions:

1. **Alpha**: The highest level of privilege. There is only one alpha account, and
it can perform all actions, including defining the points associated with each action type.

2. **Grant A**: Usually for Universities and Organization Users with Grant A can:

    - Add blocks that attribute new grants to other users.
    - Downgrade the grant of another user, provided it's not Grant A.
    - Add and verify chemical substance and reaction definition blocks.
    - Erase or update definitions of chemical substances or reactions by adding an update block, even if they are verified.
    - Declare that another block is verified, provided the block contains a definition of a chemical substance or reaction. A hash of a document containing experiment results or an essay should be provided.

3. **Grant B** Usually for verified researchers/academics : Users with Grant B can:

    - Add blocks that attribute Grant C to other users.
    - Add and verify chemical substance and reaction definition blocks.
    - They cannot erase or update the definition of a chemical substance or reaction by adding an update block.

4. **Grant C** Usually for students and the public : Users with Grant C can:

    - Add chemical substance and reaction definition blocks but cannot verify them.
    - They cannot erase or update the definition of a chemical substance or reaction by adding an update block.
## TODO : 

1. **Cryptographic Hashing**: We need a secure hash function to ensure the integrity of data in the blockchain. Cryptographic hashes are a fundamental part of the blockchain's immutability.
2. **Digital Signatures**: We need to implement a way to verify the authenticity of actions on the blockchain. This is usually done through a digital signature scheme, such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
3. **Consensus Mechanism**: A critical part of any blockchain is the consensus mechanism. This is the method by which the network agrees on the validity of transactions and blocks. The most common are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), but there are many others. We'll need to decide which one is the most suitable for our project.
4. **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: Our nodes need to be able to communicate with each other, propagate new blocks, and synchronize the blockchain state. This typically involves a peer-to-peer network.
5. **Block Validation**: When a new block is propagated to the network, nodes need to validate it by checking the block's and its transactions' compliance with the blockchain protocol rules.
6. **Points System Management**: Since our project has a points system (ie: DOCSAR coin), we'll need to implement a way to award, track, and transfer points between users.
7. **Access Control**: Given that our project has different levels of user privileges (grants), we'll need to implement an access control system to manage user permissions on the blockchain.
8. **Data Storage**: Efficient and secure data storage is crucial for our project, especially considering the chemical substance and reaction data. we'll need to design and implement a robust data model and storage mechanism.
9. **Security Measures**: Apart from the cryptographic techniques, we need to ensure the security of the blockchain network. This involves protection against various attacks such as Sybil attacks, 51% attacks, and more.

## Future Directions

DOCSAR is designed to be a future-proof, self-contained system. The flexible user contact system allows for changes in communication technology. The comprehensive chemical data schemas and flexible definitions permit the inclusion of diverse and detailed chemical information, with potential applications in numerous fields of research and industry. By democratizing access to chemical data and incentivizing contributions, DOCSAR aims to accelerate the advance of chemical knowledge.
